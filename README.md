# WebRTC based P2P Video Chat

## Project Overview

This project implements a real-time, peer-to-peer video chat system using WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) technology. The system allows users to establish direct video communication sessions in web browsers without requiring plugins or additional software.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Front-end development for interactive user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: Backend server environment for handling signaling and communication.
- **WebRTC**: Framework for real-time communication between browsers.
- **HTML/CSS**: Structure and styling of the user interface.
  
## Features

- **Peer-to-Peer Communication**: Enables direct video and audio communication between browsers.
- **Signaling Server**: Uses Node.js for signaling, facilitating peer discovery and connection establishment.
- **User Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for initiating and managing video chat sessions.
- **Responsive Design**: Supports seamless interaction across different devices and screen sizes.

## Project Structure

- **Client-side (Frontend)**:
  - HTML/CSS for layout and styling.
  - JavaScript for handling user interactions and WebRTC API calls.

- **Server-side (Backend)**:
  - Node.js server for signaling between peers.
  - WebRTC APIs for managing peer connections and media streams.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the Node.js server:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```

4. Open the application in a web browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Usage

- Open the application URL in two different browsers or devices.
- Initiate a video chat session by entering a unique room ID.
- Grant permissions for camera and microphone access.
- Start and manage real-time video chat sessions seamlessly.

## Future Improvements

- Implement additional features such as text chat alongside video chat.
- Enhance security measures for user authentication and data privacy.
- Optimize for scalability to support larger user bases and concurrent sessions.
